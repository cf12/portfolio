# about me

## the setup

i'm currently daily-driving a <mark>2020 m1 macbook air</mark> and a <mark>windows desktop</mark> running WSL2. some of my favorite programs:

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) (terminal emulator)
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) (my favorite shell, zsh is terrible ðŸ˜ )
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/) (multiplexing & terminal pane management)
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) (window positioning)
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) (launcher alternative)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) (zero-config personal VPN)

if you're interested in my config files, check out my {{ ghlink(repo="dotfiles") }}.

## vimpossible (to live without)

i'm a heavy vim user, but my [config](https://github.com/cf12/dotfiles/blob/master/src/common/.vimrc) has always been kinda sketchy and pretty barebones. people freak out at me because i use the [vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) for VSCode exclusively, but i hate how ikcy default vim/nvim feel. maybe i'm just an electron shill, idk.

btw, here's a funny clip of [georgehotz](https://geohot.com/) (aka geohot) using vim in vscode. i think it sums up my approach to vim (as well as life) pretty well.

## CTFs

i used to play in [CTFs](https://ctf101.org/) on the team [L Distribution](https://ctftime.org/team/45894). some of our notable achievements:

- <mark>2nd</mark> place UMDCTF 2020
- <mark>5th</mark> place TJCTF 2020
- <mark>14th</mark> place picoCTF 2019
- <mark>29th</mark> in country on CTFTime 2020

i highly recommend trying CTFs out if you're interested in cybersecurity, puzzles, and/or coding in general. they're super fun, and i learned the bulk of my knowledge in lower level systems, web security, compilers, cryptography, and C from participating in CTFs.

if you wanna read some of my old shitty writeups, you can find them [here](https://github.com/cf12/ctf/) lol.

## ... and more

i might add more here idk i'll have to see. maybe i'll start a blog ðŸ‘€
