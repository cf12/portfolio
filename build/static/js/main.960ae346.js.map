My name is Brian (or CF12), and I am a 14 year old currently attending Roberto Clemente Middle School.\r\n                  My story began at a very young age. I was gifted a laptop for my 10th birthday, and I instantly\r\n                  fell in love with it. Every single day, I would attempt to discover more about my laptop, and I\r\n                  slowly learned how to use my laptop. I taught myself how to type (which did not turn out so great), and I\r\n                  began programming when I was 11.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p className='main-text'>\r\n                  When I first began coding, it wasn't my primary focus. I would learn bits and bits of Python and Java on Codeacademy whenever I was bored.\r\n                  I didn't take coding seriously back then because I couldn't see the potential of coding yet. When I was in 7th grade, we took a class on Processing, a sketchbook language based off of Java. Processing was one of the fundamental\r\n                  reasons why I began front end design, because I could see visually what I was coding. And that's where it pretty much began. I don't use Processing\r\n                  anymore, but I still appreciate the classes I've taken for it. Later that same summer, my friend showed me how to use NodeJS, and\r\n                  I began expanding into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Golang, and much much more.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p className='main-text'>\r\n                  To conclude my bio, I was never a coding fanatic. I was pretty much like any other student during my middle school years. Nonetheless,\r\n                  I loved being able to see and create great visual designs with code, and that's what ultimately brought me into coding. Coding\r\n                  is a powerful tool, but if you don't make it look good, people won't realize how powerful it is.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className='right-pane'>\r\n              <img className='main-image' src={require('./images/para1_bg.gif')} alt='Not found.' />\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className='body-procon'>\r\n            <div className='left-pane'>\r\n              <div className='container'>\r\n                <div className='heading'>\r\n                  <p style={{fontFamily: 'MuliBoldItalic'}}> What I'm Decent At </p>\r\n                  <svg className='icon' fill='#FFF' height='100' viewBox='0 0 24 24' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>\r\n                    <path d='M0 0h24v24H0z' fill='none' />\r\n                    <path d='M1 21h4V9H1v12zm22-11c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2h-6.31l.95-4.57.03-.32c0-.41-.17-.79-.44-1.06L14.17 1 7.59 7.59C7.22 7.95 7 8.45 7 9v10c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h9c.83 0 1.54-.5 1.84-1.22l3.02-7.05c.09-.23.14-.47.14-.73v-1.91l-.01-.01L23 10z'/>\r\n                  </svg>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <ul style={{listStyleType: 'none'}}>\r\n                  <li className='text'> Backend NodeJS Development </li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> Frontend HTML, CSS, and JS development </li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> Discord Bot Development </li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> A tiny bit of Java </li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> Python </li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className='right-pane'>\r\n              <div className='container'>\r\n                <div className='heading'>\r\n                  <p style={{fontFamily: 'MuliBoldItalic'}}> What I'm Terrible At </p>\r\n                  <svg className='icon' fill='#FFF' height='100' viewBox='0 0 24 24' width='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>\r\n                    <path d='M0 0h24v24H0z' fill='none' />\r\n                    <path d='M15 3H6c-.83 0-1.54.5-1.84 1.22l-3.02 7.05c-.09.23-.14.47-.14.73v1.91l.01.01L1 14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h6.31l-.95 4.57-.03.32c0 .41.17.79.44 1.06L9.83 23l6.59-6.59c.36-.36.58-.86.58-1.41V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zm4 0v12h4V3h-4z'/>\r\n                  </svg>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <ul style={{listStyleType: 'none'}}>\r\n                  <li className='text'> Any type of animation / modeling </li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> C++ (Still working on it!)</li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> GoLang </li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> Finishing my chores </li>\r\n                  <li className='text'> Getting sleep </li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className='body-projects' id='projects'>\r\n            <p className='title' style={{fontFamily: 'MuliBoldItalic'}}> My Projects </p>\r\n            <div className='wrapper-projects'>\r\n\r\n              <div className='project-item' id='project1'>\r\n                <GifPlayer className='picture' gif={require('./images/project1_bg.gif')} still={require('./images/project1_bg.png')} alt='404 File Not Found' />\r\n                <p className='title'> Discord Bots </p>\r\n                <p className='desc'> When I was introduced to Node.JS and JavaScript, I began learning the language by coding Discord Bots.
